# Leveraging Graph Neural Networks and Mobility Data for COVID-19 Forecasting

This repository contains the code and supporting materials for the article  
**"Leveraging graph neural networks and mobility data for COVID-19 forecasting"**,  
published in *Applied Soft Computing* (ASOC_115242, accepted April 15, 2026).

The project investigates how **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** combined with **mobility data** can improve forecasting of COVID-19 cases. By modeling population movement patterns as graphs, we aim to enhance predictive accuracy compared to traditional epidemiological approaches.

## 📦 Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/hodfernando/Leveraging-graph-neural-networks-and-mobility-data-for-COVID-19-forecasting.git
cd Leveraging-graph-neural-networks-and-mobility-data-for-COVID-19-forecasting

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or create a Conda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment_windows_11.yml
# or
conda env create -f environment_mac_m1.yml
```

🖥️ Usage
Run the training script with your dataset:

```
python codes/'train_model'.py
```

Additional analysis scripts are available in the analisys/ folder.

📊 Results
results/ → Forecasts based on cumulative COVID-19 case data.

results_daily/ → Forecasts based on daily COVID-19 case data.

results_tune_1/ → Hyperparameter tuning experiments.

Disclaimer:  
The complete set of generated results amounts to approximately 1.3 TB of data.
Due to the impractical size, these full outputs are not included in this repository.
Instead, we provide the codebase, analysis scripts, and figure-generation routines so that results can be reproduced or adapted as needed. Selected figures and examples are included for reference.
